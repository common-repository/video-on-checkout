Say thank you to your customers using video

== Description ==

Add video with gratitude to your customers on WooCommerce checkout page and increase their loyalty:

* Tell "Thank you" to your customers and get more loyalty
* Describe how order will be processed and reduce calls to support
* Make your shop more friendly

The best Thank You pages function to get customers excited about other pages or offers on the site, rather than let the sales opportunity drop off.

One modern and effective way of making customers make another purchase is by inserting a video on the Thank You page, and that is what the prosperous e-commerce sites do.

* Video increases conversions. According to studies by Eye View Digital and co, videos can increase conversion by as much 86%, so using video gives you great opportunity to make more upsells and promote products of your shop.

* Video is easy to look. Watching a video takes little effort in comparison with reading a lengthy information or description. Videos permit you to engage an audience that may neglect the information you would otherwise convey through alphabets.

* Video deepens consumer connection. You will agree, watching a video makes you feel like there’s more engagement going on. When a client can relate more personally to your video, it enhance their connection to your service or product.

* Video is persuasive. As stated by Insivia, 90% of users say that seeing a service video influences their decisions – such as coming back. Videos help to direct and connect your client to the thing you want: sales!

* Video keeps clients on your page longer. The longer a person stays on your site, they more they become familiar with your company. A video on your Thank You page affords clients more time for your product offer to be absorbed, and to see the benefits your product will give them.


**What video can contain?**

You can insert a short video of your team or CEO to appreciate you client and state more benefits about your company. Your new customer will be more likely to return for more and remember your offer.

Also you can describe customer how order will be processed, highlight further promotions or suggest consultation
